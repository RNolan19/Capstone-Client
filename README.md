## **Welcome To CodeMitment: The App That Tracks Your Coding Habits**
---------------------------------------------------------------------
**CodeMitment is a single page web application created to help aspiring developers
track how much time they are spending sharpening their coding skills.

I chose to create this app because, selfishly, I wanted a way to track how much
time I was spending improving my coding skills.  I've always been big on tracking
my habits on a calendar, which is something I think I picked up from my father.

Say you make a goal of going for a run 4 times this week,  I've always found it
keeps me accountable and motivated when I have to look at the calendar and see
that I'm slacking for the week.  If it's Thursday and I've only ran once, just
seeing the calendar will make me tie up my running shoes.  Conversely, when you
look at your calendar at the end of the month and see that you've ran 15+ times
this month, your past accomplishments and dedication fill you with pride.

So I figured why not do the same thing for coding habits?  Except this time,
trade in the calendar for a website.    **

### **Planning Story**
For my fourth and final project at General Assembly, the initial question was:
what technologies and frameworks did I want to build my app with?
For the back-end, I chose to use Express.js and MongoDB to get more familiarity
working with Express.
For the front-end,
